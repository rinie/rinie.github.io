# Gutenberg/Semantic Series — Handover Note

Purpose: hand this file, the README, and the `note-*.md` seed notes to a new
conversation so it can continue the series without losing context. The posts
and notes are self-contained; this file captures the working conventions and
standing decisions that lived in conversation rather than in any file.

## Current state
- Series is at 72 posts. The README table is the authoritative index — every
  post, its date, its URL slug, and a one-line description.
- Posts drip-feed one per day. Latest drafted is post 72 (2026-07-25).
- All drafts and notes are in this folder (`outputs/`).

## Undrafted seed notes still on the shelf (the queue)
- note-hiding-seams-not-best-practice.md (rich, ready — the fence/seam material)
- note-waterline-evolution.md (libc, OS page size growth)
- note-let-the-90-win.md (CarPlay, Tesla, glued SIM)
- note-train-left-on-time.md (vanity metrics, the car that waits)
- note-schmiel-painter-386-move.md (non-technical "next version won't be clean")
- note-reflection-external-resolver.md (kept by explicit request)
- note-page15-vs-uuid-postit.md (UUID-as-living-room-brick angle still unused;
  the page/tar/zip/Parquet core already became post 68)

## Working conventions (the house style)
- No cheerleading, no performed enthusiasm. State the observation and stop.
- Avoid "honest/genuine" vocabulary in notes and posts; use "direct/real/actually".
- Standing prior: assume the user is correct and the Def is wrong until evidence
  shows otherwise. "The odds are worse for the Def."
- Breadth-first before drafting: check new material against existing posts for
  overlap before writing, not after. (This caught the post-63/living-room-bricks
  overlap.)
- 24-hour time notation.
- Each post ends with a "part of the series / Related:" footnote linking 3-ish
  prior posts by slug.
- Posts carry front matter: layout, title, date, tags, level (general|technical),
  description.
- Primary sources are the spine of the strongest posts (Brooks, Gall, Shirky,
  the nanomsg/Sustrik rationale). Anchor on a named, on-record source where one
  exists; present synthesis across domains as the author's framing, not as an
  established result.
- Keep the reader honest about epistemic status: where the series is re-deriving
  a known idea, say so; where it's extrapolating, flag it.

## Recurring vocabulary (so a new thread speaks the same language)
Gutenberg layer (carrier/infrastructure) vs Semantic layer (meaning); the
waterline between them; the seam and the fence that marks it; Def-Push vs
Use-Pull; the external resolver; "the user does not sux"; the 90% signal;
breadth-first seam-finding; the iceberg (frameworks) and defrosting it;
worse-is-better; logarithmic vs exponential improvement; MIT-PDCA vs
New Jersey-PDCA; essential vs accidental complexity; pace layering;
"only time will tell".

## How to continue in a new conversation
1. Upload: README.md, this file, and whichever `note-*.md` you want to draft.
2. Say which note to draft and the target date/post number.
3. The new Claude drafts the post, then adds it to the README table (bump the
   count word, append one row, verify no duplicate row numbers).

## Note on tooling
A batch of browser-automation tools has been attaching to turns in this thread;
none of the work needs them — it's all local file editing. They can be ignored.
